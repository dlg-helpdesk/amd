Folder Requirements.

[For Training]

Put training data here.

dataset/batch1/human
dataset/batch1/machine
dataset/batch1/silent

Note: you can group training data i.e batch1, batch2, batch3.

Run python train_model.py

Once it finishes the model will now be on the model folder.

If you want to test the model accuracy make sure to put test data sets on

test_dataset/human
test_dataset/machine
test_dataset/silent

Then run python test_model.py

Once you're happy with the accuracy export the model to the Api and Websocket server
